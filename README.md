# Reflection 
 
   Setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with GitHub had a few tricky parts. One challenge was understanding how to use Git commands. I wasn't sure how to create a repository or push my code. I solved this by watching online tutorials and practicing the commands step by step. It took some time, but I slowly got the hang of it.Another challenge was connecting VS Code to GitHub. I had some trouble with authentication and making sure VS Code could access my GitHub account. I solved this by carefully following the instructions on GitHub's website and double-checking my settings. I also learned about SSH keys, which made the connection more secure. To improve my portfolio, I would add more projects that show my coding skills. I'd also like to write short descriptions of each project, explaining the challenges I faced and how I solved them using VS Code and GitHub. This would give people a better idea of my coding process and problem-solving abilities.
