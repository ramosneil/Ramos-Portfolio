# Reflection 
 
   Making my portfolio was a learning experience. One challenge was deciding what to include. I had many projects, but not all showed my best skills. I solved this by asking for advice from teachers and friends. They helped me pick the projects that really highlighted what I can do.Another challenge was making the portfolio easy to navigate. I wanted people to quickly see my skills without getting lost. I solved this by using a simple website design and clear headings. I also made sure it looked good on phones and computers.If I could improve my portfolio, I would add more details about my projects. I would explain what I learned from each one and how I overcame problems. Also, I would keep updating it with new projects to show my growth. Getting feedback from others and always trying to improve will make it even better.
